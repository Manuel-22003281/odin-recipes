            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Fill a large pot with water and </p>

            <p>package instructions. Make the sauce while pasta is cooking.</p>
            <p>Drain the pasta and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook </p>
            <p>sausage until completely cooked through, about 7-10 </p>
            <p>minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute longer.</p>
